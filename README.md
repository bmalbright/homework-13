# Object Relational Mapping: Retail Back End

### The assignment was to build the back end of an e-commerce site. Given starter code, we were to build the models for the site, connect the routes. The user will be able to connect to the server, seed the database, and get, post, update, and delete elements of the database. We test the API in Insomnia. 

## Packages & APIs
### Dotenv, express, mysql1, and sequelize were installed on the app. Tests were run in Insomnia to ensure functionality. 

## Contributions
### My tutor, Ben Abbott, walked me through the assignment and got me started. Also got a bit of help from Chuck Stephens to correctly code the references in the models. I helped explain the assignment to some other classmates and walked them through getting started, but I don't believe I got code from anyone else.
